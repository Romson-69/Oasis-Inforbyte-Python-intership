# Oasis-Inforbyte-Python-intership

This repository contains Python-based projects developed during my internship. The projects include various tools and applications, such as voice assistants, health-related tools, security utilities, and web applications. Below is a brief overview of each project:

## 1. **Voice Assistant**
A voice-controlled assistant that allows users to perform tasks using voice commands. Features include:
- Searching Wikipedia

A tool to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height. It provides classifications such as:
- Underweight
- Normal weight
- Overweight
- Obese
